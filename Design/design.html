My goal for this website remains the same to create a website that is easily user-friendly and accessible, 
whilst being unique and enticing at the same time. Now I do acknowledge that this goal could change with time 
as  I build my website and grow and develop on my journey as a web designer. As for my information structure, 
I opted for a more generic and simple way of displaying my information which is why I structured my pages 
in a way that guides the user to having a smooth experience, by having my pages start from  Profile
where the user reads about the creator of the website, then to the portfolio to see some of my works.
After that it is the design page where the user will get some insights on the design insights I had to make for my website,
then lastly it will be the blogs and essay pages will provide the user with a step-by-step explanation of the design journey 
of my website along with all the adversities  I had to face.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to the user flow of the website, I want there to be clarity straight from the homepage as to what the user 
must interact with and how to do so. Starting with the display of headers on every relevant page 
the user is going to be on so that they know which page they are on and what they should expect. 
Now on the top of every page, I aim to have the direct link to the other relevant pages so that the user has freedom 
of choice as to choose which page they want to start with rather than feeling forced to go through a specific page
that does not spike their interest. Not only that but also at the bottom of each page I will have a button linking the
current page either to the next page or the previous page so that there is a sense of order.
</p>
<p>
Now at some point, I will have to either choose the buttons or direct links as keeping both kind of seems a bit reductant.
But at the current time, they serve two different purposes as one is there to take the user directly to the page 
they want hence the content they want to see whereas the other is there to link the pages in the above direct link
displayed way so that it improves the user flow.  
</p>

<p>
 The reason i went for the color scheme i went for is beacuse i am a huge fan pof Naruto the anime, so i sort of wanted
 to mimic the most prominent colors which are Green/dark green, blue and orange.

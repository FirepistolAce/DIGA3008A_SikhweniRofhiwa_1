          <h1>Digital Borders and Algorithmic Power: The U.S. TikTok Ban as a Case of Digital Coloniality</h1>

          <p>
      America enacted the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act in April 2024, 
      which among other provisions, requires ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, to demerge US operations 
      or be prohibited as a federal act (PAFACA, 2024). In January 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court and, on national security 
      and First Amendment grounds, declared it constitutional (TikTok v Garland, 2025). 
      Follow-on 75-day holds were not used by President Trump but rather than immediate legal enactment money in mid-June 2025 invested in. 
      The thesis of this essay is that the TikTok scandal illustrates how digital infrastructure is a geopolitics sandbox and enables digital
      coloniality exercisable wherein Western powers exercise digital sovereignty regimes with asymmetrical effects.  
      Referencing theoretical descriptions of internet geographies (Graham, 2014) and digital coloniality (Birhane, 2020), 
      the essay illustrates how banning TikTok disrespects data sovereignty for techno-nationalistic benefit for social digital disbenefit.
    </p>
    <h2> Context & Case Description</h2>
    <p>
    

     TikTok, with its more than 170 million US visitors, was quickly becoming a centre of next-gen youth, influencers, and political blunders.
     Congress voted on PAFACA in April 2024, mandating ByteDance out by 19 January 2025 or face prohibition. 
     It passed bipartisan supermajorities (360–58 House; 79 to 18 Senate) following backroom briefing of the national security threat. 
     Legislative critics and judiciary responded with an argument that they had no concrete evidence Chinese spymasters were employing 
     TikTok as a spyware tool and even undermining American free speech. TikTok also had brought a suit TikTok v Garland on First Amendment 
     and takings clause grounds. The Supreme Court, per curium opinion dated (17 January 2025), reinstated the Act and embraced data 
     sovereignty and the "not substantially broader than necessary" government policy. 
     The Court rationale for the same was to keep foreign rivals at arm's length in U.S. 
     data aggregation in case it was being regulating speech.
     By June 2025, Trump delays the ban due to slow negotiations among Chinese state and US investors such as Oracle and Blackstone.
     The case is thus a long asymmetric fight between digital sovereignty and worldwide digital trade.

    </p>
    <h2>Theoretical Framework</h2>
    <p>
      The TikTok ban case reminds us how three theoretical pillars intersect with one another:
      <h3>1. Internet Geographies & Digital Hegemonies</h3>
      <p>
       Graham (2014) contends that online networks are spoken from material weaponries of power wherein territorial hierarchies 
       of Western tech monopolies are inscribed. Ballatore et al. (2017) define the way search on search engines spectacularly 
       territorialized and state-bound instances internet platforms are bounded by territorial geopolitics. In the case of TikTok, 
       one can see how the content, code, and information on the website are in national control and authority 
       and not an unbiased global platform.</p><br>

      <h3>2. Coloniality & Algorithmic Domination:</h3>
      <p>Birhane (2020) demonstrates how algorithmic networks enacts and re-enacts these colonial relations of power, 
       i.e., on the continent of Africa. TikTok melodrama is truly a decolonial concern worldwide: Western nations asserting digital 
       sovereignty not to protect their own but to exert normative and cultural hegemony over what digital streams of information will 
       be permitted. This is friendship to 'techno-colonial' policy, as non-Western places are being forced to fit into Western-norming 
       digital stratifications (Verdi, 2020).</p><br>

      <h3>3. Digital Inequalities & Data Sovereignty</h3>
      <p>Lutz (2019) and Robinson et al. (2015) discuss global network size inequality of the digital through politicized access
         and capacity. The US target has reprehensible levels of TikTok attention but symmetrical ratios of risk potential observation
         targeting by U.S. and EU-hosted applications. This is because there exists a presence of an asymmetry in a loose sense: 
         data sovereignty geopolitically interested bits and privacy protection asymmetries.</p>
<h2>Critical Analysis</h2>
    </p>
     The US response to the regulation of TikTok would be digital coloniality. Tying together collectively as the 
     "foreign adversary" (PAFACA, 2024) gives the latter party a political and moral high ground in their argument about what sites 
     are allowable. Refusal of proof of Chinese government spying on its people on a state level shuts down good-faith assumption on 
     the government's part. Legality in this case is more the misuse of speculations upon information authorized for national security 
     and authorized under Supreme Court precedent. The model of regulation is predicated upon hegemonies on the internet: 
     US web hegemony beyond proper geopolitical scope, app store regulation, and judiciary overreach (Graham, 2014). 
     A hypothetical US institutional takeover of TikTok would turn it into a Western platform that lost platform sovereignty, 
     pluralized and digitalized space, and diversity of non-Western values.<br>


    Second is algorithmic manipulation of democracy. Ibrahim et al. (2025) built Republican political message bias based on algorithmic 
    recommendation on TikTok in the approach to the 2024 American election, as proof of algorithmic exposure to political messaging. 
    The ban thus also marks contested digital public space and political message ownership at the intersection of digital coloniality studies.
    Second, selective US enforcement is also normatively skewed. While TikTok enters the spotlight in the wake of the standoff with the 
    Trump administration, Facebook, Google, and Twitter among US rivals have room to practice relatively low-key national-security 
    monitoring on similar data-gathering and foreign-state commerce. US "digital sovereignty" practice thus tolls geopolitics 
    rather than rule of law.
    By sceptic denials, there are theories that it is driven by citizens' and democratic state-nation competition data security, 
    meanwhile. That virtual openness-nation security dualism is the context under which Graham's (2014) dystopian theories of the internet 
    as plural but geopolitically circumscribed, and Birhane's (2020) excitement over algorithmic power asymmetry.

    
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      US divestment or ban of TikTok is a trend, not a privacy concern or trade war that demonstrates how digital infrastructure establishes 
      a borderland of digital coloniality and tech diplomacy. The representation is asymmetrical with symmetrical norms: 
      non-Western platforms need to be disarmed and obligatory for non-Western platforms. In this case, PAFACA is a matter of data protection 
      and not an American cyber space and international internet standard ordering hegemony. 
      Until there is a desire by policymakers for the decolonization of the internet, they will have no option but to stretch beyond 
      extraterritorial platform claims.<br>
      For example, worldwide multilateral data regimes, rigorous contemplation regarding regulating algorithms ad hoc and suspended 
      protections on all platforms. In Graham's (2014) view, the internet's future hangs in the balance on the wire-thin tight wire 
      between global openness and national regulation. Whatever has occurred on the topic of TikTok in America can be consulted 
      and tracked to attempt to build more inclusive, more equitable digital worlds.

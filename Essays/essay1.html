      AVOJOZI is a creative industry festival or event that takes place in
      Johannesburg South Africa every year, hence its name. It aims to connect
      technicians, animators, writers, artist and more not just on a local scale
      but on a global scale too. Its website above is the perfect example of a
      well-constructed website that has great UI and UX. User Interface (UI) is
      the point of human and computer interaction as well as communication in a
      device. This includes display screens, keyboards, a mouse, and the
      appearance of one is desktop, (Rouse, n.d.).
    </p>
    <p>
      All the above mentioned and more allow the user to interact with an
      application or website, through visual and audio elements. User
      Interaction (UX) on the other hand is the overall experience a user has
      when interacting with a system, product, or service. This encompasses the
      entire process from initial contact and awareness to post usage, focusing
      on the user's perspective and feelings brought about the entire process.
      Lastly ethics often called moral philosophy are the moral principles that
      govern a person's behaviour or decision, in the context of web development
      and design this focuses on specificity when one situates themselves in
      their current society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website is a great example of UI and UX as it has a clean and modern
      design, with a clear layout that makes it easy to navigate. The use of
      white space and contrasting colors helps to draw attention to important
      information, while the use of images and videos adds visual interest. The
      website is also responsive, meaning it looks good on all devices, from
      desktop computers to smartphones. This is important as more and more
      people are using their mobile devices to access the internet. This essay
      aims to prove that Interaction on the web is structured through the UI and
      UX. A good starting point for this premise should be, what makes a
      reliable website, alongside with, when to spot good UI and UX design
      choices. To answer the first question, we need to look at if a website has
      the following, usability, privacy, security, transparency, accessibility,
      inclusion, safety, ethical persuasion, and sustainability. All of which
      are referred to as the principles of web design. These principles of web
      design draw upon UI to take effect. AVIJOZI's website encapsulates most of
      the above principles very well. The website is designed in such a way that
      it is not dull, but rather eye captivating as it draws your attention to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is shown in how easy it is to navigate the website; the layout is
      simple yet effective. From the moment you are introduced into the home
      screen there is a clear objective to entertain and gasp your attention
      with the colour pallet. It looks and feels legit, they highlight
      information which looks credible and relevant not to mention they provide
      all the necessary whereabout and know about on how to contact them. Now
      another aspect which they executed very well is the inclusion part, where
      even though this website is not everyone's cup of tea it does contain
      content for different people. May it be dying hard core game enthusiasts
      and animation admires or just your average event lover AVIJOZI has you
      covered.

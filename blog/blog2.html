<h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>
  Reflecting on American scholar, author of electronic literature, and innovator of hypertext Stuart Moulthrop's work,
  and how it ties in into nowadays internet and the way of doing things. I would say that Stuart Moulthrop's Hypertext,
  and laws of media set up the internet the way we know about it in the current modern age. The fact that the American author
  saw the wave of technological change approaching the world and decided to invest in works that would work in accordance
  with that change is outstanding. Hypertext and digital/electronic literature fit exactly in today's society as beings
  are living fast-paced lives, and the majority of us do not make time for simple things such as going to the bookstore and
  purchasing a book, sitting down, and reading it. Just because convenience is in the palm of our hands in the form of
  electronic devices. Moul5throp also poses a very strong observation where he states that new forms of media such as
  electronic books are not there to replace old forms of literature such as books, but rather to combat other forms of
  media such as television and hence creating a better lasting effect on the consumer in the long term. This work addresses how humans have made hypertexts and electronic books, their new substitute for hardcopy texts
  in the modern-day.

<h2>Folder structure & URL scheme</h2>
   My folder structure is designed in an orderly fashion so that I can know what to store when and how to depict it best on
   my website. This then helps the people who will interact with my website in the long run as everything shall be organized.
   First thing first, my root folders case all the bits of information that I have along with all my work, rather than having
   work displayed all over my homepage or website in general, now all one has to do to access it is go to the relevant
   folder. The folders Images, Styles, Scripts, and Blogs, are all pretty much self-explanatory. When it comes to my URL
   scheme I want it to also follow an oderly way of depicting things. First things first, the first part of the URL link should
   contain the project folder that being DIGA 3008A/. Then following that should be the root folder in which the user has just
   interacted, for example, let us say images, which is where you will find the 1st model for the wireframe of my website
   design. That would look something like diga 3008A/images/. Not only does this communicate to the users that there is 
   a hierarchy and order in the website but also it makes sense to follow in a chronological manner plus it's fitting to the eye.
   Then lastky would be the image that the user clicked on and is interacting with. DIGA3008A/images/wireframe_model.jpeg,html.

<h2>WIREFRAME image </h2>
<P> Now if you head to my images root folder there you shall find the first iteration or rather model of my website's
    wireframe, which is basically a sketch showing my homepage and how I want my users to interact with my website.
    Now granted this is a work in progress so many of the aspects of my wireframe may change with due time, research
    , and practice. But essentially the way I want my website to look is that one shall interact with the URL link which
    shall take them to my website where the first thing they shall see is a nice image subtled color background. I
    always think that having a nice background sets the tone and mood for something similar to how one sets their wallpaper.
    when navigating their eyes to the left that's when their attention will be caught by an animated drawing of me, which
    serves just as a taste to the user as to what they should look forward to. scrolling down a bit will display the welcome
    text or introduction to make the user feel like they are immersed in the website. On the right shall be the options bar
    which when pressed, they can see all of my work in the respective root folders. Scrolling down beyond that is a short
    description of me as a scholar, my hopes and ambitions as well as a little bit of information about the website.

<h2>Iteraction and World Wide Web</h2>
<p>
Now when it comes to the matter of interaction and WWW, I define interaction as having to alter, control, manipulate,
or command something and have it show you any form of feedback. The World Wide Web on the other hand is a collection
of different websites and texts/ hypertexts all at a URL click away. They are something I have considered most
definitely in the crafting stage of my wirefram as to how is my website going to be interactable and how one can access
it from WWWW.

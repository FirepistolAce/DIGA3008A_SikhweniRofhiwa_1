            <h1>Justice and Ethics </h1>
            <p>
             Being a designer and a programmer, I'm dealing with ethics and justice upfront in the design process, 
             no downstream issues to worry about. Whatever I'm doing, be it making animations, interactive art, or digital art, 
             what I'm going to be thinking is: What am I bringing in here of value? Who am I bringing in and not bringing in?
            </p>
            <p>
            The research of Flanagan, Howe, and Nissenbaum (2005) and Flanagan and Nissenbaum (2007) led me to Values at Play, 
            and it totally changed my understanding of virtual work ethics. The argument is simple: all technical choices imbue values 
            in them, and we're not even aware of it. Game mechanics, story, and system policy are value-saturated, 
            something that approximates actual power relations. That is, all technical choices have ethical consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
            Flanagan and Nissenbaum's (2007) guide on how to take ideas of fair play and put them into game form begins to make sense to me. 
            Their methodology is discovery, translation, and verification, and it shows the use of fairness and inclusion in gameplay 
            mechanics, graphics, and gameplay experience. It makes more sense to me that it begins with a level keel balance between 
            revolutionary and artistic. It's not just shouting at one point to assert that it's unfair, right, 
            it's creating the impression to the player through the game itself.
            </p>
            <p>
             I bring this principle to life, i.e., when I'm working with surveillance or AI bias. Suppose that I'm making a simulation on 
             biased algorithms. I don't just want to tell them the point, I want them to experience it and question themselves as well. 
             Ethics is not the message, it's how the project operates.
             One of the greatest things about the readings is the balance between ethics and enjoyment. 
             Flanagan et al. (2005) state that when individuals can smell something that is too preachy, they will tune out. 
             I have tuned out. Solution? Subtlety. Instead of frightening people into doing what is right and wrong, 
             I implement systems that allow them to find ethical questions for themselves.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Those words cemented it for me that online creators build culture. Our choices of story, interaction, 
            and representation are powerful. Being a good human to me is exercising that power to flip exclusion on its head, 
            make users bigger, and spark critical discussions.
            </p>

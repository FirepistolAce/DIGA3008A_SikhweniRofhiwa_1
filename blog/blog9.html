         <h1>Decolonising Technology  </h1>  
         <p>
            It is no secret that most of the world's technological innovation, ideals, solutions, and policies are heavily influenced by, 
            if not imposed, Western culture. Now, what does this have to do with code? Well, code is part of that influence that the masses 
            in power use a tool, many of us, including myself, would argue we understand the programming langmuage we use or the code we write, 
            but there is a fine line between being able to participate in something just because you have a basic understanding of it, 
            and being able to comprehend it on a deeper level. Therefore, this leads me to question how we decolonise code,
            as well as how it is viewed across technological practices. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            To understand how systems in power push code to be viewed first, I have to look at how I, as an individual,
            interact with code that I have come to know. A good starting point comes from Hanli Greyser's Dev Conf 2022 video,
            where the speaker states that no one thought/ action is responsible for everything to turn out the way it is, 
            but all of our simple, small, everyday actions eventually accumulate to the bigger problem. In this case, 
            being the colonized code we use, and I say this mainly due to the way I was introduced to coding and the coding languages 
            I have come to know. Coding is the ability to effectively take ideas in the mind and translate them into a machine, 
            and have it run tasks and errands looks and sounds simple enough on the surface level. But why not ask how come, 
            even though we all do not share the same background when it comes to code introduction, 
            we are still held to the same standards as those who have a prolific background, not to mention high amplitude for it as well.
            <P>  
            Another thing could mainly be how the rest of the world has to wait for the super nova countries such as America 
            to set and allow certain trends when it comes to code, only becomes in the past hey have had some of the leading pioneers 
            when it comes to the field, such as Microsoft and Apple just to name a few. The point I'm getting at here with the mentioned 
            companies is that they dictate the majority of the software, code, programming language, and how we use it. 
            People do not seem to understand that if the masses in power willed it, they could change some of the most basic tags in HTML, 
            for example, the anchor tag to banana,  and just say that it is more effective, and we wouldn't question a thing. 
            This is what the speaker Hanli states is to operate in the critical paradigm, one brought about by our practices 
            to follow these companies and say how high whenever they say jump. This has made me more aware of what I do when I code, 
            am I a vibe coder, that being a person who just writes one letter and then lets AI do the rest by just pressing tab and not 
            checking everything, or even worse, they just let AI handle everything in total. 
            Or am I a coder who understands the functionality of the code I am writing, yet I do not question why certain tasks are done 
            the way they are done? 
         </p>
         <p>
            When it comes down to it, this is a lot to handle, let alone digest,  because the question then becomes, 
            how do I deviate from mindless slave practices? Well, a good practice is to be aware of information going around at all times, 
            the majority of which is propaganda / fake news. Start being more proactive in whatever I engage in, 
            and question things as to why and how they are done. Stop making assumptions based upon preconceived notions brought about by 
            the systems in control, In retropesct all of the above I am guilty of but now that I'm aware of, 
            the only way to make a change is one code at a time and be way more aware of what I'm being asked to do, 
            what I am doing and how I'm doing it. 
         </p>
         <h2>Implementing  JAVASCRIPT </h2>
         <p>
            When it comes to implementing JavaScript on my website, I have a few ideas of where it will serve a great purpose, 
            and although I haven't implemented it yet, I have been watching material on it, like YouTube videos under the title of 
            the Oddin project. One of the places I want to start implementing it right away is my blogs, replacing the second nav bar 
            for blogs, and instead having buttons with a smooth transition to navigate between blogs. Also, on my homepage, 
            so that it becomes more eye-catching, either through animations or maybe a model I've done in the past. 
            Hopefully, my implementation of Java doesn't go as horribly as my implementation of CSS, which was a mess.

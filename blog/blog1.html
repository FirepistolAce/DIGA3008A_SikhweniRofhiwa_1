    <header><h1>Setting up Git-Hub</h1></header>
    <p>
      This first week was quite overwhelming in terms of the influx of
      information that was presented to us,  which is kind of ironic since one
      of the topics we were presented with was that of Jorge Luis Borges and his
      argument of how the vast amounts of information available online to us on
      the net, can lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed, depicted in the form
      of his work: The Library of Babel. Firstly, I enjoyed that this module
      included somewhat of an introduction to GitHub and how to get used to it
      let alone set it up. This I found to be very helpful if I'm speaking for
      myself, as someone familiar with git but not good at utilizing it yet,
      this introduction sort of reassured all the insecurities  I had about this
      module going into it. Not only that but the way current and future tasks
      were presented in class conveyed a feeling of fun and learning new things
      that would be beneficial to me in the long run of my career. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When coming to the readings, I found them quite interesting and
      informative following how things turned out now in the current age we live
      in. I found Borges's work to be very interesting when comparing his
      ideology to the current way of doing things in our society when
      interacting with information. The fact that he talked about how we are
      bombarded with information daily on the web to the point where we start to
      feel burdened by it, Not only that but some of the information is
      contradictory and ambiguous as well as incomplete. This pretty much sums
      up the entirety of the internet nowadays not to mention all other forms of
      media, such as local news, news outlets, and mainstream media. To show
      readers how this feeling of being overwhelmed looks he depicts a picture
      of the library of Babel. Which depicts excess amounts of texts, stored in
      one place for safe keeping and retention of memory which would otherwise
      be impossible for impossible for humans to remember.

      when looking at the history of the web. I was shocked to see the first
      somewhat prototypes that Pioneers such as Bush and Nelson came up with
      before the creation of the actual World Wide Web. Especially Ted Nelson
      who coined both the terms Hypertext and Hypermedia. His work on his
      project Xanadu, shares common characteristics with most websites on the
      internet nowadays with the interface he was talking about in his early
      studies. The way he builds up hypermedia from hypertext is outstanding
      simply because he took the act of organizing ideas in an interconnected
      style, mimicking his brain's thinking process, and revolutionized it into
      creating a worldwide "docuverse", so he called it where all information
      was interconnected connected contextually by links. Leading to things such
      as hyperlinks which make tracking information on the web easy.
    </p>

      Further on Vanevar Bush, talks about a memory expansion electromechanical
      device for interacting with microform docs. Honestly listening to it now,
      when hearing it now it sounds like the computer before the actual
      computer, but the difference is that he envisioned it as a device that
      would allow comprehension and storing of individual texts, serving as a
      mechanized consultant one that retains and stores information better than
      humans.   My goals for this course at the very end are to be able to take
      in a piece of information, digest it, analyze it, and as well as evaluate
      how can it make life better or rather can it be above the current state it
      is already in. Sort of similar to how Jorge Borges, Bush, and last but not
      least Nelson did in their times.

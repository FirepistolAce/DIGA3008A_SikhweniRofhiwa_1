    <h1>Interaction design process</h1>
    <p>
      This week I focused more on my semantic markup, plus interaction design.
      For the first time in my web design journey, I had to think through my
      choices and not just scribble things onto my website because they looked
      good aesthetically. My design had to communicate to my user(s) how I
      wanted them to interact with my website. An example of this included the
      process of navigating in between pages, whether I wanted to make this a
      button-based action, or rather just have links accessing the coherent page
      directly. Not only that but the placement of the buttons/ links also
      matters, as this dictates the flow of my website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placement of the options at the top could convey a sense of clarity and
      have the agency to immediately skip to the following page not necessarily
      having read the previous page. On the other hand placement of the next/
      previous options at the bottom of the page could imply that I want the
      user to interact with the current page at hand before they even think of
      skipping it, forcing them in a way to finish the contents of the current
      page or just scroll endlessly and tirelessly before reaching the options.
      Since I have not found a way to integrate buttons into my website
      currently, I decided to stick with the direct links, as this is the most
      convenient choice right now. When it comes to the placement, I opted for a
      top-of-the-page placement, I want my users to have that feeling of agency,
      being in control of their actions and being forced to interact with a page
      they do not want to interact with.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I look back at my first Wireframe design, I do admit I
      overcomplicated things a bit by adding too much visual aesthetics which
      would otherwise be falling under the stylish aspect of my journey. I am
      grateful though that I did keep my design simple yet effective as it
      communicates everything the user may need to know about my website without
      being overly complicated. Reflecting on my website preparation and design
      work so far I can say I am proud of the progress I have made, and filled
      with anticipation for what is to come. I haven't encountered that many
      adversities but I would say at times visualization of the ideas in my head
      was difficult and implementing these ideas. What I would like to improve
      on going forward is making my website unique and different from other
      generic websites since it shares the core basics with the more generic
      ones, may it be colors, tones, images, or content inside it, all of that
      has to reflect me and my personality.

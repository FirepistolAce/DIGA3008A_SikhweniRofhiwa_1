    <h1>Ui & Ux analysis </h1>
    <h2>Chocolate tribe and Avijozi </h2>
    <p>
The websites mentioned above are the ones I wish to draw inspiration from regarding my UI and UX design. 
The reason I chose them is because they are well-known pioneers in the field of digital arts, 
known locally and internationally, and also they do intakes of students such as myself.
Therefore there is a good chance that the websites above were worked on by a former student 
such as myself so I should be able to implement if not incorporate some of their UX and UI.
    </p>
    <p>
As you can see their homepage shares the same vision as my first wireframe where I talked about either
implementing an image background or a live background wallpaper image. 
Also, the navigation bar is something that is very similar to mine, 
as it appears consistently on each and every page you interact with, which is what I strive to add to my website.
</p>
    <p>


Their pages also share similarities in the way they are displayed, as they use simple shapes overall throughout the whole website, 
something which I appreciate as it will save me time and hopefully not be hard to implement as compared to using complex shapes.
Also, most of their works are visual works which I relate to being an animation artist,
but the way they display them is unique as the moment you hover over them they pop up a bit.
    </p>
    <p>  
The above image is an example of how well they integrated their semantic markup and both UI and UX to work well,
structuring their information in such a way that it doesn't overwhelm the readers,
yet it's engaging and entertaining by having a font heading that resembles the color of the page they are currently actively on,
is detailed I picked up whilst going through this website and I appreciated it a lot.
    </p>
    <p> 

Pros 

Most of the things I pointed out are reproducible and align with my website.
The color scheme and font also share a few comparisons.
The use of simple shapes in the styling of pages.
The website is a visual studio website, so there is a lot of inspiration and ideas I can get from it.
Cons 

Some of the Ui and UX aspects of this website may be too complicated such as the ever always changing background
live images and videos on the homepage.
Although my website and theirs share a few similarities it may be hard to implement the things, 
I pointed out since the two websites serve different purposes, because theirs is business-oriented and mine is private or individual.

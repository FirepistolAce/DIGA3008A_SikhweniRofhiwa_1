<h2>How Geography Shapes and is Shaped by the Internet</h2>
<p>
  Now, when going through this passage, there were a lot of key points that caught my attention and addressed very well how the internet
  and the geographical location influence each other. So, going further on with this analysis, I will state a key point, expand on it,
  and also explain why it resonated with me or caught my attention. Now, the beginning of the passage explains the rise of the internet
  and how people saw it as an opportunity across many sectors of life in which they could benefit from,
  but what they failed to comprehend is the illusion that the internet created. It stood to benefit more according to the difference in locations
  and location factors that required its services, plus the three following factors: communication costs, transportation costs, and search costs.
</p>
<p>
What people failed to see is the fact that the internet decreased the above three significantly, hence creating a feeling of convenience and dependency on it.
The first way the internet does this is cleverly, and that is by killing off the need to have to pay much or hassle a lot just to attain information,
or rather, communicate information. Which plays right into human psychology, as we as humans are always looking for more innovative and effective ways
to do things, not the right tedious way, but rather efficient. When looking at it, it may seem like the internet has a lot of loss in the process,
but the truth is that they can just set up their servers and the other tech gizmos and be done with it. 
Secondly is where I feel personally the biggest convenience comes in, and that is through killing the need to travel just to attain something or see something.
The internet truly killed off two birds with one stone here, because although this may help certain locations like in the rural areas 
and other isolated locations it does indeed come back to bite us back, because by doing so, the internet has played right into our innate nature
to be a bit lazy at often hence we wont have to travel anymore like before just to attain information.
Nor do we have to go to certain landmarks just to experience them, as everything can be brought right straight to you from the comfort 
of your own home and screen, depending on the medium one is using.
</p>
<p>
  When it comes to the last aspect, search cost, it is a byproduct of the other two, whereby if the other two exhibit signs of having a lower cost, 
  that typically means that this one also experiences a low cost. Going further, the article starts to challenge the integrity of the internet on whether
  it is here for the greater good or just here to get rid of certain tasks and activities that are necessary for human life. 
  One of the things that it substitutes for is the death of distance, as mentioned in my point before, 
  whereby humans do not feel the need to travel to certain parts of the world to either attain knowledge, information, or goods and commodities,
  because everything is just a click away.  Another point is that the internet has started killing off the need to hire specific individuals at firms 
  in certain locations, especially those with requirements for it to thrive, although it may serve as a huge help to someone in the rural areas
  by bridging the gap of distance and information scarcity it overall is dentrimental to some areas, 
  and mostly these are areas with a high use influx hence why the cost of internet provision will always be higher in urban areas.
</p>
<p> 
  Now, of course, all of the above is location-based based hence why it won't always have the same effect across all areas. Then the question becomes, 
  how do we go forward in such a way that we co-exist with it but not let it kill off some important parts of our lives? 
  Now the passage argues that the Internet has changed how people do business by lowering communication, transport,
  and search costs—but the benefits vary by place. Some areas gain more because of local preferences, tools available, and other offline factors. 
  The idea that the Internet kills distance is too simple; geography still matters. Researchers still do not fully understand why only a few places
  are seeing major economic gains. Also, it's hard to measure how the Internet affects trade. Future research should focus on how newer tech, 
  like smartphones, social media, and apps, shapes the economy in different areas.  And I truly believe if we can learn to alternate and also assign
  what needs the internet versus what needs human intervention, we shall truly be better off

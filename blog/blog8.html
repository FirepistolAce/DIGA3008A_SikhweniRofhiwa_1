          <h1>Critical Reflection</h1>
          <p>
            Critical Analysis of Christoph Lutz's "Digital Inequalities in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data"
          </p>
          <p>
            Christoph Lutz's Digital Inequalities in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data points to how new technologies 
            are not just tools of advancement, but also social forces of fragmentation. While AI and big data are as much hailed for their capacity
            to optimize efficiency, decision-making, and innovation, Lutz criticizes how these technologies have the potential to widen existing inequalities, 
            particularly among those who are already at the margins of the digital economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the strongest arguments Lutz makes is that digital inequality is less about access to the internet these days it's more about how data
            is being utilized and who has the power to control or hijack these systems. He explains how AI systems reproduce social bias
            because they are trained on biased data. For example, facial recognition software has been discovered to perform worse on darker-skinned people,
            and that translates into actual harm in the world in the form of misidentification or discrimination. 
            Reading this made me think more in terms of critical analysis of how "neutral" technologies are never really neutral but 
            instead reflect values and structures existing in the society in which they are created.
          </p>
            <p>
            Lutz also discusses how those already digitally disadvantaged by race, education, or income are less able to benefit from AI and big data, 
            and more likely to be watched or taken advantage of by them. This aligned with some of my thoughts about technology today. 
            We tend to talk about access as though giving someone a phone or internet connection addresses all issues,
            but it doesn't account for how those technologies are being used by people rather than by them. It's like giving a person a seat at a table
            but not permitting them to speak.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a critical stance, Lutz's article squarely fits into a digital justice approach. It shatters the master narrative that technology
              is good and causes us to ask: good for whom? As a media and tech student, I value this perspective because it shifts the focus from innovation
              to effects. It makes me understand that when developing or employing digital systems, we need to keep ethics, accountability,
              and inclusivity central
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, Lutz's book is a reminder that AI and big data are not technological innovations but social forces. If we are to have a more equal,
              not less, future, then we need to take seriously who has the power of these technologies and who gets pushed out or hurt by them.
            </p>

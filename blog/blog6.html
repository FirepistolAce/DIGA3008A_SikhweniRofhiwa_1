    <h1>  Research: Internet, Society and Design Justice</h1>
    <p>
     In this blog, I will be discussing the readings I found most interesting from the course.
     The readings are from the World Economic Forum interview with Nanjira Sambuli, 
     the Design Justice Network website, and the Internet and the Just Society website.
    <p>
     One of the readings that struck me was the World Economic Forum interview with Nanjira Sambuli about digital equality.
    Sambuli stresses that although access to the internet is growing worldwide, 
    proper digital equality continues to be unattainable for many, particularly in the Global South. 
    What struck me was her argument on the "meaningful access" to the internet—not access for the sake of access, 
    but access which facilitates participation, creation, and empowerment. 
    Sambuli believes that the digital divide is not so much about physical connectivity but also socio-economic matters,
    local content availability, and digital literacy. 
    That made me think about how inequality online is a reflection of offline structural inequalities. 
    I also researched her other work with the Web Foundation, and I noticed a thread: digital policy must be co-designed
    with the communities it touches. That resonates with what the Design Justice Network advocates design processes centered
    on the voices of marginalized communities.
    </p>
    <p>
    This ties in directly with another solid source I researched: the Design Justice Network website. 
    The principles stated there shift away from just making tech more "inclusive" 
    towards resetting the systems and power structures that govern technology design.
    Principle 3 was my favorite: "We center the voices of those who are directly impacted
    by the outcomes of the design process." Too much of the time, tech is designed in Silicon Valley
    with no real awareness of where exactly it'll be used. For instance, 
    facial recognition software was discovered to discriminate against dark-skinned faces 
    since it had been trained on unrepresentative datasets. 
    That is a straightforward account of what occurs in the absence of design justice.
</p>
    <p>
    Other cross references to be drawn are with the Internet and the Just Society website, 
    with blog posts that talk about the ways digital worlds may reflect or disrupt social power structures.
    One of the blog posts I found helpful was on digital inclusion and how most policies approach access to technology
    as the endpoint, not the beginning. It contended that empowerment without inclusion can lead to digital spaces
    where marginalized users exist but continue to have no voice or control. This supports Sambuli's contention
    that digital equality has to involve engagement in the design of the digital tools and spaces people use. 
    It also supports the Design Justice perspective that we need to redesign things with justice and equity at the core,
    not layer diversity on unjust systems.


    <p>  
    Both sources together made me understand that justice in the digital world isn't just about having access
    or even being included it's about having agency.It's not enough to close the digital divide through technology,
    we must inquire who is creating technology,
    for whom, and with what consequences. As future digital citizens or creators, we must insist on systems that are fair by design,
    not an afterthought.

    <h1>Interaction design and user alignment</h1>
    <p>
      This week was all about critical thinking and planning out the interaction
      design aspect of my website. To do that first I had to understand a few
      terminologies under the concept of web design and interaction, defined as
      the meeting point between an active body and something that can affect in
      some way, Bardin, R (2023). The definition then led me to the following
      key points to pay close attention to when designing my website, the
      responsiveness of the website, semiotic design ( what it communicates and
      how it does it), and lastly useability. Now a big part of anyone going
      onto any site is how effectively the site responds to the user's specific
      needs. Since I'm not efficient in CSS styling yet I gave this part of my
      design some thought as to when I do start styling alongside the design
      process.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion I finally came to was that keeping my layout and User
      Interface simple yet effective is the best thing. Understanding that a
      generic approach to doing things is sometimes better than overly
      complicated ways. Having a simplistic navigation bar or button option
      rather than a visual effects animation every time before your user has to
      access a window is a far better design choice. Hence I decided to keep my
      homepage simple yet functional, with a drawn image of myself, next to it a
      welcome text, and then on the far top left the option button which will
      display all the other windows accessible on my website, making the site
      just responsive enough without feeling a little too overbearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now a lot of why I decided to go with such a simple outline has to do with
      the second point, which is the semiotic design. One of my favorite sayings
      is "If it's not broken do not fix it" which ties into my ideology in this
      case of simplicity being the best choice. I believe that although we live
      in an innovative time, sometimes the core underlying ways/processes or
      rather a way of designing things still work best even in our current
      fast-paced and ever-changing time. Hence why I chose a simple design
      layout because I want my users to feel comfortable and acquainted with my
      website, I also have had the experience of being a user on a website that
      was overly complicated, and esthetically pleasing but could have gone the
      simple route in terms of semiotic design and intractability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, useability, what kind of devices should I bear in mind whilst
      still designing my website, what users do I have in mind and lastly what
      kind of experience do I want them to have in the short or long period they
      interact with my website? All of those are questions that crossed my mind
      whilst I was brainstorming this point. I decided that just like any good
      website I want mine to be accessible from all kinds of devices regardless
      of size no power. Not only that but it must be accessible to everyone open
      to learning, listening, or who just wants to browse the web for some
      inspiration if not dopamine. Lastly,y users should feel a sense of
      curiosity as to how they can create a website, I want my website to
      inspire, enlighten, and entertain above all else so that more and more
      people can click on that URL link and get the exposure of a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third-week exercise helped me connect the dots to my question of why
      URL naming schemes and semantic mark-up are so important and should be
      something that I push to achieve on my website. This ties into the point I
      made about wanting my website to convey a feeling of familiarity and
      comfort and to do that, there has to be order on the website so that users
      alongside myself as the creator do not clash or get confused and end up
      hating the website. URL schemes are good practice for that because the
      more organized and clear one's URL is the better understanding the users
      will have when they decide to click on a window in the website, not only
      that but the line of communication from the website to the use then
      becomes even clear as the user knows how to interact with the website to
      get the results they want.
